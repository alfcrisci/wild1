v. 1.06--Review draft submitted for approval by USGS.

v. 1.07--Approved release provided via CRAN.

v. 1.08--Revised to improve generality of 'partition.intervals'

v. 2.00--Upgraded functions for home range analysis.

	 Hereafter, home ranges will be represented by the 
         "Polygons" class from package "sp."
         This standard will promotes integration of methods for
         analysis and plotting.

	 Package "gpclib," which is subject to license restrictions
         is now suggested rather than required.	

	 New functions for home range estimation:

	   'ud.kde' for estimation of utilization distributions

           'hr.kde' for extraction of kernel density home range contours

  	   'hr.mcp' for minimum convex polygon home ranges (revised
               version of function from v. 1.08; use of the new version
               [strongly recommended] will require changes in dependent 
               code)
	

	 Data manipulation

	   'drop.holes' extracts "Polygons" that are not holes  

	   'gpc.to.Poly' constructs objects of class "Polygons" from
               objects of class "gpc.poly"

  	   'point.in.Poly' applies 'point.in.Poly' to "Polygons" objects
  
           'Poly.to.gpc' constructs objects of class "gpc.poly" from 
               objects of class "Polygons"

	   'restrict.domain' for limiting the geographic extent of point
               patterns represented by vectors, matrices, or data frames

	   'trim.xy' identifies outermost points in a point pattern


	 Graphics

	   'hr.kde,''hr.mcp,' and 'restrict.domain' include flexible high-
               level plotting routines; 'trim.xy' produces a diagnostic
               plot 
	   
	   'plot.Poly' for plotting "Polygons" objects
